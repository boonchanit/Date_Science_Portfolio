## Machine Learning
https://github.com/boonchanit/Date_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Project_house_prediction.ipynb : A model to predict the value of given house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle using various statistical analysis tools. In this notebook, I use Gradient Boosting Regressor to get a better model and score. The model got better scores up to 90.71% on a test set. It still reduces mean absolute error from the first time up to 50.55%

https://github.com/boonchanit/Date_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Suv_purchase.ipynb : To build a model that accurately predicts whether customers will purchase SUV cars or not.

## Data Analysis and Visualisation
https://github.com/boonchanit/Date_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/KPMG.ipynb : Analyze customer with their demographics and attributes. Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. Visualization with interactive dashboards using Google data studio.
